# Steal The Case

## Description
You are an agent of a secret organization who has been sent to a luxurious business meeting at a mansion. Your mission is to infiltrate the party, steal a briefcase containing information about the chemical formula for a biological weapon that a nefarious corporation plans to use, and escape undetected, no matter the cost. You will navigate through different scenarios within the mansion and find objects with various functions, such as weapons (to neutralize enemies), distractions (to distract enemies), outfits, tools, and keys. These outfits are particularly important because certain locations within the mansion can only be accessed by certain types of people (chefs, security personnel, police, etc.), and you will need to obtain the necessary outfits to infiltrate these areas. Outfits are obtained by neutralizing enemies who are wearing them, so you will need to be selective when neutralizing enemies as your weapons are limited and will be depleted with use. You must do so silently, as if there are multiple enemies in the room, they will discover you. This is where the distraction objects come in, as they help to distract certain enemies so you can neutralize others without being detected. By default, you have a defined space to carry 5 items, and each of these items occupies a defined space (outfits do not take up space, as you can only wear the one you are currently wearing, not store them). However, within the mansion there is a backpack that, if found, will allow you to carry twice the number of items to use while trying to complete the challenge. However, if your backpack is full, and you want to pick up an important item, you will have to first drop an item from your inventory (this will not be lost, it will simply remain in the room). To use any item in the inventory, you must first open the inventory and then use the item. To win, once inside the vault, you must "use the papers" to complete the game.
